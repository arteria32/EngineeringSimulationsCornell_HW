# Description #
All the content in this course will be available from the start. You can go through it at your own pace as your schedule permits. Modules 1-3 cover finite-element analysis (FEA), modules 4-5 cover computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and module 6 covers how to couple these two methodologies for fluid-structure interaction analysis.  If you are interested only in CFD, you can go through the introduction section in module 1 and then skip to module 4. Modules 5-6 are optional and do NOT count towards your final score and the verified certificate. 
The instructor and teaching assistants will be answering questions on the discussion boards. You will see their posts tagged with a blue "staff" label. However, they cannot respond individually in a course of this size. Please help your fellow students if you know the answer to their questions by posting in the discussion boards.
